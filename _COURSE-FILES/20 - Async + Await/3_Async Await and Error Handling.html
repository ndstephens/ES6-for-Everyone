      // Async/Await still works with Promises and the Promises are constructed the same way.  Async/Await is basically built on top of Promises.  We 'asynchronously wait' for the values that come back from the Promises

      // This 'breathe' function, that returns a Promise, is the exact same as in the previous file.
      function breathe( amount ) {
        return new Promise( ( resolve, reject ) => {
          if ( amount < 500 ) {
            reject( 'That is too small of a value' );
          }
          setTimeout( () => resolve( `Done for ${amount} ms` ), amount );
        } );
      }

      //
      // Await can ONLY be used within an Async function
      // if you ever need to use even a single 'await' in a function, there's no detriment to turning it into an 'async' function
      async function go( name, last ) {
        console.log( `Starting for ${name} ${last}!` );
        // the value that is 'resolved' from the promise function, 'breathe', is sent to the variable 'res'...not sent onto a 'then()' statement like with Promise chaining
        // 'await' waits for the Promise to resolve or reject before sending anything onto the variable it's assigned to ('res')
        const res = await breathe( 1000 );
        console.log( res );
        const res2 = await breathe( 300 );
        console.log( res2 );
        const res3 = await breathe( 750 );
        console.log( res3 );
        const res4 = await breathe( 900 );
        console.log( res4 );
        console.log( 'end' );
      }


      // ERROR HANDLING
      // One way (old school) is to wrap everything in the async function in a 'try' block, followed then by a 'catch' block if there are errors (see below)
      // That is still very useful for specific and simpler error handling

      // BUT instead...we can use a High Order Function.  It wraps over another function(s) and can act as a 'catch-all' for errors
      // Great for handling multiple errors in a similar way w/o having to write a lot of try-catch statements

      // the High Order Function for error catching/handling
      // returns a function that can accept any number of arguments and assigns it to a variable (that assigned variable/function also now houses the 'fn' function that was passed in)
      // when that assigned variable/function is called, its arguments are passed onto 'fn' and 'fn' is called/ran
      // now it's like calling 'fn' directly, but with 'fn' having a 'catch' block attached to it for error handling
      function catchErrors( fn ) {
        return function ( ...args ) {
          return fn( ...args ).catch( ( err ) => {
            console.error( 'Ohhhh nooo!!!!!' );
            console.error( err );
          } );
        }
      }

      // turns 'wrappedFunction' into a function that can accept any number of arguments, and houses the function 'go'
      const wrappedFunction = catchErrors( go );

      // when called, it will pass its arguments onto 'go' and 'go' is called/ran
      // it's the same as running 'go' directly, but now with a 'catch' block assigned to it for error handling.
      wrappedFunction( 'Wes', 'Bos' );

          console.log( res );
